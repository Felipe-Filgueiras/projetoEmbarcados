## Documentation
-ESP-WROVER-KIT is a highly integrated ultra-low-power development board, with rich peripheral set, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity offered by Espressif's flagship SoC, ESP32. Create Internet cameras, smart displays, or Internet radios by connecting LCDs, microphones, and codecs. ESP32 supports JTAG debugging, while the ESP-WROVER-KIT integrates a USB debugger. This makes debugging and tracing complex applications very easy, without the need for any additional hardware. ESP32 is engineered to be fast, smart, and versatile. The ESP-WROVER-KIT complements these characteristics by offering an on-board high-speed Micro-SD card interface, VGA camera interface, as well as a 3.2 SPI LCD panel and I/O expansion capabilities. Have you been developing your applications around the ESP32-WROOM-32 module? Not only does the ESP-WROVER-KIT support the popular ESP-WROOM-32 module, but it also supports ESP32-WROVER module that has additional SPIRAM for your application's use.
